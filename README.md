## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd employee-tracker
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Database Setup

This application uses PostgreSQL. You need to have a PostgreSQL server running.

1.  **Create a database:** Create a new database for the employee tracker.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE employee_tracker_db; -- Or whatever name you prefer
    ```
2.  **Connect to the database:** Connect to the newly created database.
    ```bash
    \c employee_tracker_db;
    ```
3.  **Run the schema script:** Execute the `schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables.
    ```sql
    \i db/schema.sql
    ```
4.  **Run the seeds script (Optional but recommended):** Execute the `seeds.sql` file to populate the database with initial data.
    ```sql
    \i db/seeds.sql
    ```
5.  **Configure database connection:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (or configure your `connection.js` file appropriately) to store your database credentials. **Do not commit your `.env` file to GitHub.**
    *   Example `.env` file:
        ```
        DB_USER=[Your PostgreSQL Username]
        DB_PASSWORD=[Your PostgreSQL Password]
        DB_NAME=employee_tracker_db
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=5432 # Default PostgreSQL port
        ```
    *   [If your connection logic doesn't use environment variables, explain how to configure the connection string in `connection.js` here.]

## Usage

Once the database is set up and dependencies are installed, you can run the application from your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

You will be presented with a menu of options. Use the arrow keys to navigate and the Enter key to select an option. Follow the prompts to interact with the employee database.
